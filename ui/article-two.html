The cold winter breeze sent a chill down my spine.I was standing on the edge of my house balcony gazing at the million stars that twinkled like diamonds carved brilliantly and complementing the dark nights sky. Apart from the soft rustling of the leaves caused by the occasional breeze the air around me was filled with silence.Suddenly a hand grabbed me from behind.I recognised the familiar touch of my husband.We tied the knots just a couple of months back and shared the house with our parents and his sister.They took the ground floor and we both lived upstairs which had a huge bedroom with a kingsize bed in the centre.The bedroom extended into a balcony which overlooked the serene view.I took a deep breath and relaxed in his hands.I was wearing a plain white shirt which hung  just below my bottom.He wore that shirt to work in the morning and it still carried his scent,my favourite one in the whole world.The room behind was dimly lit.There was a reflection of us in the shiny glass door of our balcony.I gaped at the way he looked. He was stunning in his white tees and black shorts.I could hardly take my eyes off him.The tees was quite transparent and I could see the insides.He held a cup of tea in his hand and the aroma was quite refreshing.He smiled at the way I looked and adored him,the smile that could make any girl go nuts.He held out the cup and offered me a sip. He kept hugging me while we both alternatively took sips from the tea cup.He noticed me shivering from the cold and pressed me tighter to his body.I felt his fingers trace the lines of my back.My heart beat raced and there was the familiar inrush of current on my insides. A million thoughts crowded my mind but I could hardly utter a word.I sensed he was going through the same for I noticed his breath steadily becoming heavier and heavier. The wind blew my hair over his face.He brushed it away turned me around and planted a soft kiss on my lips.It felt warm and heavenly.I looked into his eyes and kissed him back.The heat lingering between us drove away the outside cold.I took off his shirt and sat between his legs and laid my head on his chest.It felt cold yet incredible.He hugged me from behind and we stayed close to each other gazing at the stars in silence.I lost track of time.We laid in each others arms and I watched him fall asleep.I stayed awake watching him sleep the whole night while he held me tightly even while sleeping.It was one amazing night!
