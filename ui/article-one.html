It was not a dream
she could feel the warmth of the sun 
and the kiss of a gentle breeze
she was in a world,
a world whose inhabitants 
stared right past her
without the least knowledge of her existence

she was not a phantom 
and was as alive as anyone could be
yet she was invisible 
she drifted to places
unknown to mankind
though she never moved an inch

the people there became her new family
and mixed emotions lingered in the air
at good times she smiled with pleasure
and cried her heart out when there was a misfortune
but her laughter and tears were never heard

she was alone invisible yet happy
she could go on for days without food or sleep
but alas when she came to the end of the world
the world created by authors 
tears rolled down her eyes 
and she finally turned the last page of the book with a heavy heart.
